## Q: Can I load both NPB and MLB at the same time?

Technically possible, but not recommended.

This NPB historical mod is built on top of the MLB historical database structure - think of it as an NPB skin over the MLB framework. You could load both databases from different paths and add them together, but you'd likely run into issues like duplicate players (guys who played in both leagues).

More importantly, NPB is set at the same level as MLB in this mod, which would create balance issues if you merged them.

This mod is meant to be played standalone.
